### A command line text editor written in rust 
---
**Why am I making this?**
- I think it's a great intermediate project 
- I've always wanted to learn rust and I figured a project like a text-editor would be pefect
- My origninal motivation was to learn vim, so I figured if I remade vim I would be pretty good at it

Features that I still need to implement
---
- actually writing text
- adding a configuration file
- add copy and paste support
- add visual mode
- allow commands to be executed from the editor
- implement basic vim motions into the editor

Current Bugs and Issues
---
- I need to fix how I handle line numers
- make the cursor more natural

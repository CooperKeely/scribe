### A command line text editor written in rust
---
**Why am I making this?**
- I think it's a great intermediate project 
- I've always wanted to learn rust and I figured a project like a text-editor would be pefect
- My origninal motivation was to learn vim, so I figured if I remade vim I would be pretty good at it
